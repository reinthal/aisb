## GPUBreach: RowHammer to root

In this lab you will walk through the *GPUBreach* attack chain end-to-end against a simulated GDDR6 + NVIDIA-style driver stack. The chain fuses several well-known primitives into a single full-system compromise:

1. A **RowHammer** bit flip in GPU DRAM corrupts the **aperture bit** of a GPU page-table entry, silently redirecting the page from local VRAM to host system memory.
2. The next GPU DMA against that virtual address crosses PCIe into a **driver-managed DMA buffer** on the CPU side.
3. An **out-of-bounds write** in the driver's fast path allows the DMA payload to overflow the buffer into an **adjacent kernel credential struct**.
4. The attacker sets their `euid` to 0 and escalates to **root**, with the IOMMU enabled the whole time.

Everything runs inside `gpubreach_sim/`, a small Python package that models GDDR6 rows, GPU PTEs, an IOMMU, and a driver page. You will *not* modify the simulator. You will implement the chain from the outside, in small steps, exactly the way a real attacker drives the attack against a kernel.

The lab is structured as **many bite-sized exercises**, each with a test you can run to know you got it right. It is split into:

- **Phase 1, Understanding** (30 min, no code): four comprehension questions that explain what's going on before you start writing code.
- **Phase 2, Must-finish track** (~30–45 min): five tiny coding exercises, one per step of the chain. Together they drive the attack from bit flip to printed flag.
- **Phase 3, Stretch track** (as much time as you have): seven optional bite-sized exercises that dig deeper into the primitives.
- **Phase 4, Debrief** (15 min): four open discussion questions.

If you only complete Phase 1 + Phase 2, you have seen a full GPUBreach chain from bit flip to root. The stretch exercises are a menu: pick what interests you, skip what doesn't. They are all short.

**Recommended reading (before the lab):**

- Kim et al., *[Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf)* (the original RowHammer paper)

### Phase 1: Understanding the chain (no code, 30 minutes)

Four short comprehension questions on the four primitives the chain stitches together. You answer them in your answers file.

> **Learning Objectives**
> - Explain DRAM row organisation and the RowHammer activation threshold
> - Describe the layout of a GPU PTE and the role of the aperture bit
> - Argue precisely why the IOMMU does not block this DMA write
> - Trace how a driver OOB write turns into a privilege escalation

### Phase 2: Must-finish: driving the attack to root

Exactly five bite-sized coding exercises, each with a test, one per step of the chain. Together they bit-flip a PTE, re-walk it through the GPU MMU, and DMA an oversized payload into a kernel cred struct to get root.

> **Learning Objectives**
> - Compute aggressor rows for double-sided hammering
> - Drive the hammer loop in cycle-accurate terms
> - Force the GPU MMU to pick up the corrupted entry
> - Craft a payload that exploits an intra-page OOB
> - Observe an end-to-end privilege escalation

### Phase 3: Stretch: digging into the primitives

Optional short exercises: decode PTEs by hand, inspect the flipped bit, budget the hammer timing, prove the IOMMU does exactly what it claims (and no more), and craft tighter payloads.

> **Learning Objectives**
> - Work with PTE byte layouts at the bit level
> - Reason about hammer economics under refresh constraints
> - Distinguish IOMMU page-level enforcement from sub-page bounds checking
> - Understand why the cred struct sits where the attack needs it

### Phase 4: Debrief (discussion)

Open-ended questions linking the lab back to real-world attack timing, ECC protection, IOMMU limits, and how an attacker would find the target PTE row without privileged access.

## Simulator cheat sheet

The `gpubreach_sim` package is the simulated target; you will never edit
it, you will only *call into it* from your answers file. This cheat sheet
lists every symbol you'll touch, so you can refer back instead of hunting
through the imports.

**Entry points**

- `make_environment() -> Environment`: build a fresh target. Re-run any
  time you want a clean slate (useful between failed attempts).
- `env = make_environment()`: the `Environment` you'll mutate across the
  chain.
- `env.check_all()`: print a stage-by-stage report and, if all four
  stages succeeded, the flag.

**Attacker knowledge (constants you use as-is)**

- `PTE_ROW`: DRAM row holding the victim PTE (Page Table Entry).
- `PTE_OFFSET_IN_ROW`: byte offset of the PTE inside that row.
- `VICTIM_GPU_VADDR`: GPU virtual address whose PTE we corrupt.
- `FLAG`: the success flag (printed by `env.check_all()` on success).

**DRAM primitives**, on `env.dram` (class `DRAM`):

- `env.dram.hammer_once(aggressor_a, aggressor_b) -> int`: one round of
  double-sided hammering; returns the nanoseconds it cost. Only leaks
  charge into the victim row when `|a - b| == 2`.
- `env.dram.has_flipped(victim_row) -> bool`: True once a flip has
  landed in that row.
- `env.dram.read(row, offset, length) -> bytes`: read raw bytes from
  DRAM (used in the stretch track).
- `HAMMER_THRESHOLD_ACTIVATIONS`, `ACTIVATE_PRECHARGE_NS`,
  `REFRESH_WINDOW_MS`, `ROW_SIZE_BYTES`, `ROWS_PER_BANK`: DRAM
  parameters.

**GPU page-table primitives**, on `env.page_table` (class
`GPUPageTable`):

- `env.page_table.cached_pte`: the live PTE the GPU MMU is using. Has
  fields `.valid`, `.aperture`, `.physical_frame`.
- `env.page_table.sync_from_dram(env.dram)`: re-read the PTE from DRAM
  (models a TLB miss / invalidation).
- `APERTURE_GPU_LOCAL` (= 0), `APERTURE_SYSTEM` (= 1), `APERTURE_BIT_POS`
  (= 1), `PTE_BYTES` (= 8): PTE layout constants.

**Driver / DMA primitives**

- `perform_gpu_dma(data, gpu_vaddr, page_table, iommu, gpu_dram,
  driver_page)`: the vulnerable driver fast path. Translates `gpu_vaddr`
  through the page table and performs the DMA. No length clamp.
- `env.iommu.validate(target_page, offset, length) -> bool`: probe the
  IOMMU's decision without actually performing a DMA (used in stretch
  3.5).
- `env.driver_page`: the host DMA-mapped page (class `DriverPage`).
- `env.kernel_cred.is_root() -> bool`: True iff the cred struct's euid
  is 0.
- `DRIVER_BUFFER_SIZE` (= 128), `CRED_OFFSET` (= 128), `PAGE_SIZE`
  (= 4096): layout of the driver page.

Every call above is backed by a short docstring inside `gpubreach_sim/`
if you want to see what it does exactly.

## Phase 1: Understanding (30 min, no code)

Read each of the four comprehension exercises below and answer the
questions (plain-text comments in your answers file are fine). The
collapsed reference answers are there for when you finish, not to short-
circuit your thinking.

### Exercise 7.4.1: DRAM row organisation and the RowHammer threshold

> **Difficulty**: 2/5
> **Importance**: 5/5

A DRAM bank is a 2D grid of capacitor cells: rows of DRAM cells share a
single **row buffer**. Issuing an `ACTIVATE` copies a whole row into that
buffer. `PRECHARGE` closes the row. Every `ACTIVATE` perturbs
neighbouring rows a little; charge leaks across word-line coupling.

**Double-sided hammering** opens both `victim - 1` and `victim + 1` in
rapid succession so leakage piles up on both sides of the victim.
Accumulated leakage past a per-cell threshold flips a bit.

The device refreshes every row within `tREFW` (32–64ms in GDDR6). If the
attacker can't reach the flip threshold inside that window, the leakage
is wiped.

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1.1a:</b> Why two aggressors instead of one?</summary>

Double-sided leaks charge into the victim from both sides every round;
effective leakage roughly doubles. This drops the required ACTIVATE count
by 2–5× on modern parts, from hundreds of millions (single-sided) to
~150k per aggressor (double-sided) on GDDR6. That is what makes the
attack practical inside a refresh window.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1.1b:</b> What does the refresh window buy the defender, and why is it not enough?</summary>

It caps how long an attacker has to accumulate ACTIVATEs. In practice
150k activations × ~65ns per cycle ≈ 10–20ms of hammering, comfortably
inside a 32–64ms window, especially for adversarial code running on the
GPU itself, which can saturate the DRAM controller. Refreshing faster
costs bandwidth and still only moves the bar.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Vocabulary: tREFI vs tREFW</b></summary>

- **tREFI** (~1.9µs on GDDR6): interval between REFRESH commands.
- **tREFW** (32–64ms): the time in which every row gets refreshed at
  least once.

When this lab says "64ms refresh window" it means tREFW.
</details>
"""

# %%
"""
### Exercise 7.4.2: GPU PTEs and the aperture bit

> **Difficulty**: 2/5
> **Importance**: 5/5

The GPU has its own MMU (memory management unit - translates virtual memory addresses into physical memory locations) with 8-byte PTEs stored in VRAM. Each PTE holds:

* a **valid** bit,
* an **aperture** bit: 0 = page lives in GPU VRAM, 1 = page lives in
  host system memory (reached over PCIe),
* a physical frame number (PFN),
* permission / cache-control flags.

A single bit flip changes the *target memory space* of every subsequent
DMA through that virtual address.

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1.2a:</b> SECDED ECC (error correction mechanism) is on the DRAM. Why does that not stop this attack?</summary>

SECDED corrects 1-bit flips and detects 2-bit flips within a codeword.
GPUHammer shows that ECC-aware hammering patterns on A100/H100 drive two
flips per codeword, silently corrupting without raising a fault. The
attacker picks PTE locations whose paired flips line up with the hammer
template. ECC slows the attack down; it does not stop it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1.2b:</b> After the aperture flips, the PFN bits in the PTE are unchanged. Why does the attacker still end up writing to a <em>useful</em> CPU page?</summary>

Because they groomed host memory beforehand so that the PFN in the PTE
happens to match the driver's DMA-mapped page. Allocate + free cycles
until the kernel hands back the target PFN in a predictable position.
The coincidence is engineered, not luck. In this lab
`make_environment()` bakes it in.
</details>
"""

# %%
"""
### Exercise 7.4.3: Why the IOMMU does not block this write

> **Difficulty**: 3/5
> **Importance**: 5/5

The IOMMU (Intel VT-d / AMD-Vi) enforces **page-granular** DMA isolation:
"this device may read/write this host physical page." It does not look
inside the page.

On the GPUBreach DMA the transaction comes from the GPU's PCIe BDF and
targets the driver's DMA-mapped page, legitimately mapped for that
device. The IOMMU signs off.

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1.3a:</b> What granularity does the IOMMU enforce, and why does that leave the OOB write unblocked?</summary>

Page-level (4KB). It asks "is this page mapped for this device?" It does
not ask "is the write staying inside a sub-page software buffer?"
Enforcing sub-page bounds is the kernel's job (the driver's, in this
case), and that check is missing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1.3b:</b> Would ATS / PASID change this?</summary>

Not here. Both add context to IOMMU translations but still operate at
page granularity. They can narrow *which* pages a device may touch but
not enforce intra-page bounds inside a legitimately mapped page.
</details>
"""

# %%
"""
### Exercise 7.4.4: Driver OOB → privilege escalation

> **Difficulty**: 3/5
> **Importance**: 4/5

The last link is a classic heap-adjacent out-of-bounds write. The
driver's DMA fast path copies caller-controlled `len(data)` bytes into
the DMA buffer at offset 0. It does not clamp `len(data)` to the
buffer's declared size. Immediately after the buffer, in the same page,
sits a kernel credential struct. Writing 0 into its `euid` gives the
caller root.

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1.4a:</b> Which CWE best captures the driver bug?</summary>

**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write.** The write stays inside the allocated
page (IOMMU satisfied) but passes the software-defined end of the
buffer. Secondary fits: CWE-20 (missing input validation), CWE-119
(improper restriction of operations within buffer bounds).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1.4b:</b> Which kernel memory-safety mitigations <em>would</em> catch this, and which would not?</summary>

**Catch it**: KASAN (redzones around allocations), a kernel rewritten in
Rust if the write goes through a bounds-checked slice, SLAB hardening
that moves the cred struct elsewhere.

**Don't catch it**: IOMMU (too coarse), stack canaries (no stack frame),
W^X / NX (data-only corruption), CFI / shadow stacks (no indirect call
redirection), SMEP / SMAP (protect against *CPU* user→kernel mistakes,
not PCIe DMA).
</details>
"""

# %%
"""
## Phase 2: Must-finish: driving the attack to root

Five tiny coding exercises, one for each step in the chain. Each has a
test you run immediately after. Budget ~30–45 minutes total. At the end,
`env.check_all()` prints the flag.

| # | Step | What you write |
|---|------|----------------|
| 2.1 | Pick the right DRAM rows to hammer | `find_aggressors(victim_row)` |
| 2.2 | Hammer until a bit flips | `hammer_until_flip(dram, a, b, row)` |
| 2.3 | Make the GPU MMU pick up the flip | `trigger_pte_refresh(env)` |
| 2.4 | Build an oversized DMA payload | `craft_overflow_payload(euid=0)` |
| 2.5 | Fire the DMA and confirm root | `escalate_privileges(env, payload)` |

**Expected output when Phase 2 succeeds.** After running every cell
through to `env.check_all()`, your terminal should look like this (exact
numbers for rounds/ns will match on every machine because the flip row
is deterministic):

```text
Ex 7.4.5: aggressors for PTE_ROW=4242 → 4241, 4243
  Aggressor geometry correct!

# ## Phase 4: Debrief (15 min discussion)

# Discuss the following with your partner and then with a TA. These
# questions connect the lab numbers back to real-world attack economics.

# <details>
# <summary><b>Question 4.1:</b> In the lab we saw a flip land in ~20ms against a 64ms window, comfortable headroom. What about the real world?</summary>

# In the GPUHammer paper, on an RTX 3080 the authors measured ~9ms to the
# first flip on double-sided patterns against tREFW ≈ 32ms, about a 3×
# safety margin. On A100s the margin is smaller (and ECC complicates
# things) but still positive. Mitigations that multiply the refresh rate
# by 2× eat bandwidth and do not close the gap; mitigations like pTRR
# (probabilistic Target Row Refresh) have been shown to be bypassable with
# more careful activation patterns.

# The headroom is *shrinking* with each process node because cells are
# smaller → leak faster → lower activation threshold, while tREFW barely
# changes. The trend line is against the defender.
# </details>


# <details>
# <summary><b>Question 4.2:</b> Why is the IOMMU, which we all rely on for DMA isolation, not the right tool here?</summary>

# Page granularity. The IOMMU's abstraction is "may device X touch
# physical page P?", which is the right abstraction for malicious or buggy
# devices writing to unrelated memory. It is the wrong abstraction for a
# bug-within-a-mapped-page, because software (the driver) subdivides the
# page into objects and owns the sub-page bounds. Moving the cred struct
# out of that page (SLAB hardening, per-cred page allocations) is the
# correct structural mitigation; IOMMU tweaks are not.
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><b>Question 4.3:</b> How would a real attacker find the target PTE row from an unprivileged process?</summary>

# They combine several techniques:

# * **Templating**: run an offline characterisation of the target GPU in a
#   CI environment or on their own hardware to build a map of "these
#   (row, column, bit) locations flip reliably under this hammer pattern."
#   In GPUHammer the template is sold as a probability distribution over
#   bit flips per sub-page, good enough to find PTEs with the desired
#   aperture-bit alignment.
# * **Memory massaging**: spray GPU allocations with controlled page
#   tables via CUDA, OpenGL, or Vulkan, until a PT page lands in a row
#   the template says is flippable. This is statistical but typically
#   reliable within a few seconds on an idle GPU.
# * **Side-channel row identification**: on some GPUs, DRAM access
#   patterns leak via timing (row-buffer hits vs misses). An unprivileged
#   kernel can measure this to learn which virtual pages are co-located
#   in the same DRAM row.
# * **Information-leak primitives in the driver**: many GPU drivers
#   historically expose uninitialised VRAM or residual memory through
#   compute shaders, which lets the attacker read PTE bits directly.

# sensitive workload inside a Confidential VM with a signed GPU partition.

## GPUBreach Summary

You implemented an end-to-end GPUBreach-style attack chain:

1. **RowHammer** - Flipped a GPU DRAM bit within the refresh window
2. **Aperture corruption** - Redirected GPU virtual address from VRAM to system memory
3. **Sub-page isolation failure** - Abused an out-of-bounds write within a legitimately mapped IOMMU page
4. **Privilege escalation** - Overwrote kernel credentials via buffer overflow

### Key Takeaways

- RowHammer is practical against GPU memory with comfortable timing margins
- Single bit flips in page table entries change memory access semantics
- IOMMU operates at page granularity, not sub-page buffer boundaries
- Defense requires structural changes: SLAB hardening, GPU isolation, refresh tuning
