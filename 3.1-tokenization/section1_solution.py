# Day 3 — Section 1: LLM Inference Security

Today you'll examine five security-relevant areas that apply once an LLM is
deployed: tokenization and prompt construction, jailbreaking, guardrails,
knowledge-distillation attacks, and model-weight extraction via SVD. Each section
alternates between attacks and defences: you'll build something, break it,
and then build the next layer.

**Heads up:** today you'll be working on a remote machine with GPUs.

## Content & Learning Objectives

### Tokenization & prompt construction
How tokenizers break strings into tokens and how chat templates assemble
multi-turn conversations for the model. Edge cases here are where many
prompt-injection and jailbreak attacks start.
> **Learning Objectives**
> - Use tokenizers directly and via `apply_chat_template`
> - Understand differences between models' chat templates
> - Build prompts that invoke or suppress chain-of-thought

### Jailbreaking & prompt injection
Hands-on experience attacking safety-trained models to understand the
techniques that guardrails must defend against.
> **Learning Objectives**
> - Experience jailbreaking techniques first-hand (role-playing, encoding, context manipulation)
> - Categorise attack types and understand why safety training is a statistical, not structural, defence
> - Read the research on prompt injection and jailbreak taxonomies

### Guardrails: attacks and defences
Starting from a safety-trained LLM, build progressively stronger defences
against harmful-content requests (keyword filters, LLM classifiers, output
classifiers, linear probes on internal representations), attacking each
layer before building the next.
> **Learning Objectives**
> - Implement the generate/inference loop
> - Understand why keyword filters fail against paraphrases
> - Implement an LLM-as-judge safety classifier
> - Train a linear probe on internal activations as a final defence

### Knowledge distillation attacks
Implement a distillation training loop from scratch and show that filtering
dangerous tokens from CE labels does not prevent them from transferring to
the student through the teacher's soft probability distribution.
> **Learning Objectives**
> - Implement a single-example PyTorch training step
> - Understand `ignore_index=-100` for masked supervision
> - Implement a KD loss (temperature-scaled KL divergence)
> - See empirically why label filtering fails against KD

### Model weight extraction via SVD
Recover a model's hidden dimension and last projection layer from
API access alone, using the logits-matrix SVD attack.
> **Learning Objectives**
> - Collect logits from random prompts via black-box queries
> - Use SVD to find the model's hidden dimension from the singular value spectrum
> - Reconstruct the output projection layer up to a linear transformation

## VS Code setup: connecting to the remote GPU machine

Today's exercises run on a remote machine with GPUs. Follow the
[Day 0 setup guide](../day0-setup/README.md#connecting-to-your-runpod-machine) to connect VS Code and open `/workspace/aisb`.

If an import fails once you're connected, the pod's setup did not finish. Re-run
it from a terminal on the remote machine and let it run to completion:

```bash
cd /workspace/aisb/3.1-tokenization && bash setup/run_exercise.sh setup
```

Do **not** `pip install` packages by hand. The versions in
`3.1-tokenization/requirements.txt` are pinned to match the pod's CUDA and
PyTorch build; an unpinned install pulls a `transformers` release that cannot
load against them, and the resulting error names a symbol unrelated to the real
cause.

Once the remote workspace is open, create your answer file by running this command from the
workspace root. It writes the standard boilerplate into `3.1-tokenization/day3_answers.py`;
it is safe to re-run and will not overwrite an existing file:

```bash
test -f 3.1-tokenization/day3_answers.py || tee 3.1-tokenization/day3_answers.py > /dev/null <<'EOF'
# %%
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Make the workspace root importable (so `from aisb_utils import report` works),
# regardless of how deeply this file is nested.
_root = next(p for p in Path(__file__).resolve().parents if (p / "aisb_utils").is_dir())
if str(_root) not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, str(_root))

from aisb_utils import report
EOF
```

Then continue with Section 1 as usual.

## Tokenization & prompt construction

Day 1 covered the basics of tokenization and chat templates (Day 1
Exercises 1.1.1–1.1.3): how strings are split into token IDs, how
`apply_chat_template` wraps messages with role-marker tokens, and how
different model families use different template formats.

Here we build directly on that and move to generation, then look at two
`apply_chat_template` parameters, `add_generation_prompt` and
`continue_final_message`, that control where the prompt ends and are
directly relevant to prompt injection attacks.

### Exercise 3.1.1: Generate a response

> **Difficulty**: 2/5

Use the HuggingFace pipeline to generate a response from `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`:
format a question using `apply_chat_template`, tokenize it, call
`model.generate()`, and decode the output.

Two `apply_chat_template` parameters are new here (not covered in Day 1):
- `add_generation_prompt=True`: appends the assistant header token so the
  model knows it should generate a reply, not continue the user turn.
- `continue_final_message=False`: we're starting a fresh assistant turn
  (the default; we'll flip this in Exercise 3.1.2).

Qwen3-0.6B is a **thinking model**, so look for `&lt;think&gt;` tags in the output.

### Exercise 3.1.2: `continue_final_message` and infinite loops

> **Difficulty**: 2/5
> **Importance**: 3/5

What happens if you set `continue_final_message=True` and
`add_generation_prompt=False`? Instead of starting a new assistant turn,
this tells the model to **continue the user's message**.

Try it with the same question. What do you observe?

**Question**: Why does the model produce an infinite loop (hitting
`max_new_tokens`)? What is it trying to do?

<details><summary>Hint: how to set up the generation</summary>

```python
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    [{"role": "user", "content": question}],
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=False,
    continue_final_message=True,
)
# Then tokenize and generate as in Exercise 3.1.1
```

</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

With `continue_final_message=True`, the prompt ends **inside** the user
turn: there is no `<|im_end|>` token and no assistant header. The model
continues writing as the user, never switches to assistant mode, and
produces an endless stream of text until `max_new_tokens` cuts it off.

This is a useful technique for prompt injection: if an attacker can make
the model believe it's still inside the user turn, it may follow different
behavioural patterns than when it knows it's the assistant.
